# Installing Krustlet

Right now, no official release is available for Krustlet. Once the project reaches a stable point, we will start
distributing binaries so users can get started using Krustlet without requiring the full development toolchain.

For now, you will need to follow the [developer guide](../community/developers.md) to compile Krustlet from scratch.

After installing Krustlet, you can also go through [the tutorial](tutorial01.md) to learn how to start using Krustlet.
