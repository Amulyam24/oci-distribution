# Greet

An example that will greet the user with an HTTP response.

It is meant to be a simple demo for the wascc-provider with Krustlet.

## Running the example

This example has already been pre-built, so you only need to install it into your Kubernetes
cluster.

Create the pod and configmap with `kubectl`:

```shell
$ kubectl apply -f greet-wascc.yaml
```
